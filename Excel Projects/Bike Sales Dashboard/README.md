# Bike Sales Dashboard

The "Bike Sales Dashboard" is a comprehensive visual tool designed to provide insights into customer demographics and purchasing patterns in relation to bike sales. The dashboard includes interactive filters on the left-hand side that allow users to segment data by Marital Status (Married, Single), Region (Europe, North America, Pacific), and Education level (Bachelors, Graduate Degree, High School, Partial College, Partial High School).

# Key Components:
1. Average Income Per Purchase: This bar chart displays the average income of customers who purchased bikes, segmented by gender (Female, Male) and purchase status (Yes, No). The chart reveals income disparities between genders and whether or not they made a purchase.

2. Customer Age Brackets: This line chart shows the distribution of bike purchases across different age brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old). It compares the number of purchases (Yes, No) within each age group, highlighting which age bracket is most likely to purchase a bike.

3. Customer Commute: This line chart examines the distance customers commute and how it correlates with bike purchases. The distance categories range from 0-1 miles to 10+ miles. The chart differentiates between customers who purchased bikes (Yes) and those who did not (No), offering insights into commuting patterns and purchase behavior.

# Each of these visualizations is designed to provide actionable insights, allowing the user to analyze how various factors like income, age, and commuting distance influence bike sales across different regions and demographic segments.
