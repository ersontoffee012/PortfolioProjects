# Coffee Orders Data Dashboard
The "Coffee Sales Dashboard" is a dynamic tool designed in Excel to provide a comprehensive analysis of coffee sales across various dimensions. The dashboard offers insights into sales trends over time, geographic performance, customer segmentation, and product preferences.

# Key Components:
1. Order Date Filter: A date filter at the top allows users to narrow down sales data to specific time periods, with an interactive timeline that spans from May 2021 to the present. Users can select specific months or years to focus on.

2. Total Sales Over Time: A multi-line chart that tracks total sales (in USD) over time, segmented by different coffee types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta). This visualization helps identify trends and seasonal variations in coffee sales.

3. Sales by Country: A horizontal bar chart that displays total sales by country, showing the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The chart helps to identify key markets and compare sales performance across regions.

4. Top 5 Customers: Another horizontal bar chart that highlights the top five customers by total purchase value. This chart allows for the identification of high-value customers and aids in targeted marketing efforts.

5. Product Filters: The dashboard includes filters for Roast Type (Dark, Light, Medium), Size (0.2 kg, 0.5 kg, 1.0 kg, 2.5 kg), and Loyalty Card status (Yes, No). These filters allow users to segment the data based on product characteristics, providing a more granular analysis of sales.

# Excel Skills and Techniques Used:
1. Data Visualization: Created line and bar charts to visually represent sales trends, customer segmentation, and geographic performance. Applied custom color schemes and formatting to align with the coffee theme.

2. Interactive Filters: Implemented slicers and timeline controls to allow users to interact with the dashboard, filtering data by date, product type, and customer segments. This enhances the user experience and provides customizable views of the data.

3. Conditional Formatting: Used conditional formatting to highlight key metrics and ensure that important data points are easily identifiable, such as high sales regions or top customers.

4. Data Aggregation: Aggregated sales data by different dimensions (time, product type, customer, and geography) to create meaningful insights that can drive business decisions.

5. Pivot Tables: Utilized pivot tables to efficiently summarize and analyze large datasets, providing the backbone for the dashboard's visualizations.

6. Chart Formatting and Customization: Customized chart elements such as axes, data labels, and legends to improve readability and ensure the dashboard communicates insights effectively.
