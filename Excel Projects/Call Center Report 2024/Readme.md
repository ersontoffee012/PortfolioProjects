# A Call Center Report Dashboard for 2024, which presents key performance metrics using Excel with advanced techniques such as DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), conditional formatting, pivot tables, and formulas. Here's a breakdown of the elements:

# 1. Key Metrics Panel (left side):
Calls: Displays the total number of calls (1,000).
Amount: Total revenue generated from calls ($96,623).
Duration: Total duration of calls in seconds (89,850).
Average Rating: An average customer rating score of 3.9 out of 5.
Happy Callers: Shows the number of satisfied callers (307).

# 2. Call Trend Line Chart:
-- Displays the number of calls per month over the year, showing peaks in April and July.
-- A line chart visually captures these trends.

# 3. Day-of-the-Week Breakdown (Bar Chart):
-- Shows how calls are distributed throughout the week, with Saturday having the highest number of calls (161) and Thursday the lowest (128).

# 4. Female vs. Male Callers Comparison:
-- A stacked bar chart compares the distribution of male and female callers in three cities (Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus). Cincinnati and Cleveland have a higher number of female callers, while Columbus has more male callers.

# 5. Rating Distribution Bar Chart:
-- Displays the distribution of customer ratings (from 1 to 5 stars). The majority of ratings are 4 stars, followed by 5 stars.

# 6. Call and Amount by Representative:
-- Two separate bar charts compare the number of calls and the amount generated by each representative (R01 to R05). Representative R02 has handled the most calls (218), while R05 has generated the highest amount ($20.1K).

# 7. Revenue by City and Representative:
-- A detailed pivot table shows the revenue generated in different cities (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus) by each representative (R01 to R05). The conditional formatting highlights the highest revenue figures in darker shades, helping identify top-performing cities and representatives.


# This dashboard combines advanced Excel features such as:

1. DAX formulas to calculate and aggregate complex data metrics like total calls, revenue, and average ratings.
2. Conditional formatting to visually emphasize key figures, especially in the revenue pivot table.
3. Pivot tables to dynamically present data by filtering through representatives and locations, allowing easy manipulation of the dataset.
4. Advanced formulas are likely used to automate data processing, especially for calculating summary metrics and performing data aggregation across various dimensions.

# This dashboard offers a clean and organized visualization of the call center's performance, making it easy to track trends, compare team performance, and identify areas for improvement.
