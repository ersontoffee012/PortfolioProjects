# PowerBI Portfolio

# 1. Advanced Data Modeling
-- Relationships: Understanding and setting up relationships between different tables is crucial. This involves creating one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships to ensure that data flows correctly across the model.
-- Calculated Columns and Measures: Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures that help in performing complex calculations that arenâ€™t directly available through your data sources.
-- Hierarchies: Creating hierarchies within data fields (e.g., year > quarter > month) to allow for drill-down features in visualizations.

# 2. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Mastery
-- Calculated Fields: Use DAX to create calculated fields that allow for complex mathematical operations, conditional logic, and text manipulation.
-- Time Intelligence Functions: These are essential for calculating Year-to-Date (YTD), Month-to-Date (MTD), and other time-based metrics.
-- Filter and Context Manipulation: Understanding how to manipulate row and filter contexts in DAX formulas to customize how data is aggregated and displayed.

# 3. Custom Visualizations
-- Custom Visuals: Power BI allows for the integration of custom visuals either through the Power BI marketplace or by developing your own using tools like D3.js.
-- Conditional Formatting: Apply conditional formatting to visuals (e.g., changing colors based on values) to enhance readability and insights.
-- Bookmarks and Selection Pane: Use bookmarks to capture specific views of your report and the selection pane to control the visibility of report elements, enabling the creation of interactive storytelling with your data.

# 4. Complex Dashboards and Interactivity
-- Drill-Through and Drill-Down: Enable drill-through features to allow users to navigate to detailed reports or sections based on a selected data point. Drill-down features allow users to explore data across different levels of granularity within the same visual.
-- Tooltips: Custom tooltips can be created to show additional information when hovering over a data point, providing richer context without cluttering the visual.
-- Buttons and Navigation: Use buttons to create a more interactive experience. These can be used for navigation between different pages of a report or triggering actions like switching between different views or visuals.

# 5. Performance Optimization
-- Data Reduction Techniques: Implement data reduction techniques such as aggregating data, using DirectQuery for large datasets, or pre-filtering data to enhance performance.
-- Optimize DAX Queries: Writing efficient DAX queries to ensure that complex calculations do not slow down the report. This includes avoiding complex, nested calculations when possible and using variables to store interim results.
-- Model Size Management: Managing the size of your data model by removing unnecessary columns, avoiding storing data in the model when not needed, and compressing data.

# 6. Integration with Other Tools and Services
-- Power Automate Integration: Use Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow) to automate tasks related to Power BI, such as data refreshes or sending notifications based on report triggers.
-- Embedding Power BI Reports: Embed Power BI reports into other platforms (e.g., SharePoint, Teams) or custom applications to enhance accessibility and user experience.
-- API Usage: Utilize the Power BI REST API to automate report generation, data refreshes, and other tasks programmatically.

# 7. Data Transformation with Power Query
-- M Language Proficiency: Gain proficiency in the M language, which is used in Power Query for complex data transformations. This includes merging, appending, pivoting, and unpivoting data.
-- Advanced Data Cleansing: Use Power Query to clean and preprocess data, including handling missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies across different data sources.
-- Data Source Integration: Efficiently manage and combine data from multiple sources, such as SQL databases, Excel files, cloud services, and APIs.

# 8. Storytelling and Presentation
-- Narrative with Data: Focus on the storytelling aspect by arranging visuals in a way that tells a coherent story, guiding the user through the insights step by step.
-- Annotations and Explanatory Text: Use text boxes, annotations, and data labels to provide explanations and context within your visualizations.
-- Responsive Design: Ensure that your reports are responsive and look good on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Mastering these skills and techniques in Power BI allows us to create not only complex visualizations but also highly effective and insightful data reports that can drive decision-making and provide valuable business insights.

# Feel free to download and explore. I included the raw data so you can create your own visualizations. :D 
Note: The raw data needs cleaning.
